1. Introduction

Brazilian developments on the Regional Atmospheric Modeling System - BRAMS

BRAMS IS A NUMERICAL MODELING SYSTEM DESIGNED FOR REGIONAL SCALE ATMOSPHERIC 
FORECASTING AND RESEARCH, WITH FOCUS ON ATMOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY, AIR QUALITY 
AND BIOGEOCHEMICAL CYCLES.

BRAMS is based on the Regional Atmospheric Modeling System (RAMS) originally 
developed at CSU/USA. BRAMS software is under a free license (CC-GPL). 
Currently, it is developed and maintained by CPTEC/INPE, USP and others 
institutions in Brazil and abroad. BRAMS/RAMS are multipurpose numerical 
weather prediction models that were designed to simulate atmospheric 
circulations spanning from hemispheric scales down to large eddy simulations 
(LES) of the planetary boundary layer. Several new functionalities and 
modifications were included to improve the numerical representation of key 
physical processes over tropical and subtropical regions (Freitas et al., 
2005, 2009), a complete in-line module for atmospheric chemistry and aerosol 
processes (Longo et al., 2013), as well as a state-of-the-art model for 
simulation of atmosphere-surface exchange of water, energy, momentum, 
carbon and others biogeochemical tracers (Moreira et al., 2013).
